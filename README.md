# Kronos Sample Project

This is an extensive sample project that showcases how to use different features of the plugin such as matchmaking, creating parties, setting up lobbies, joining matches and more! The sample project is created with blueprints in UE 4.27.

By default, the active Online Subsystem is the Null Subsystem. You can test most features in the editor right away. The Steam Online Subsystem is preconfigured for the project as well, so if you are ready to run standalone tests, just change the DefaultPlatformService in the project's DefaultEngine.ini and you are all set.
