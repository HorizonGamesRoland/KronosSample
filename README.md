# Kronos Sample Project

This is an extensive sample project that showcases how to use different features of the plugin such as matchmaking, creating parties, setting up lobbies, joining matches and more! The sample project is created with blueprints and is available for both Unreal Engine 4.27, and 5.0 onwards. The `main` branch is the Unreal Engine 5 version, while the `UE-4.27` branch is the older version.

By default, the active Online Subsystem in the sample project is the Null Online Subsystem. You can test most features of the plugin in the editor right away by starting two standalone clients. The Steam Online Subsystem is also preconfigured for the project! If you are ready to test with Steam, just change the `DefaultPlatformService` in the project's `DefaultEngine.ini` and package the project.
